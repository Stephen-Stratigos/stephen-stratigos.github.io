			<p>
				This job would be one that I would find ideal to me. The role is machine learning engineer and it appeals to me because of my interest in the field of machine learning.
				The job involves engineering algorithms and systems to collect and colate data to optimise customer engagement and experience with the companies technology.
			</p>
			<p>
				The role requires an MSc or PhD in computer science, computational mathmatics or a related field. It also requires knowledge of SQL, R, Python and scientific python modules such as numpy and scikit.
				The role demands a background in machine learning and/or data science and proven experience with machine learning, machine learning frameworks and optimization algorithms.
			</p>
			<p>
				My current skills and experience are far from what is needed for this role and I have no qualifications in any of the fields required but it fits in with what I am working towards.
				Currently I have some skills and experience with programming but its mostly self taught and likely has holes. I feel like for the most part I could consider myself at an intermediate level with programming but due to being self taught probably have some holes in my knowledge that might be considered beginner level.
				My experience is mostly with personal projects that are usually few and far between which leaves me in this space where I know and understand a fair bit but due to infrequent practice of skills I often need to fiddle with something or look up reference material to remind myself exactly how some things work.
			</p>
			<p>
				I plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience for this or a similar role by continuing studies as I can and work my way to the qualifications I need, using on the job experience in increasingly similar roles as I progress through my career and studies and by researching and developing skills at home while working on personal projects.
