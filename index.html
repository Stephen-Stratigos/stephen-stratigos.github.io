			<p>My wife and I</p>
			<p>	My name is Stephen Alexander Stratigos. My student number is S3587233 and my student email is S3587233@student.rmit.edu.au.
				I am 33 years old. I was born here in Australia in Manly hospital. My mother was born in Australia and my father came here from England when he was 15 years old.
				I currently reside on the central coast of NSW where I have spent the majority of my life but have lived in Gympie Queensland for about 5-6 years.
				My mothers side is Greek but have been in Australia for several generations now. The only language I speak is English.
			</p>

				Currently my education is basically high school level with a little TAFE and some small pseudo courses peppered in. 
				Most things I have learnt since high school have been self taught through personal interest or learnt through employment.
				One hobby I have is coding. I love to sit down and work through logic problems step by step just like a computer and therefore really enjoy creating programs.
				I once wrote an approximately 2000 line discord bot with api integration with a mobile game that was used heavily by the games community that at its peak had around 200,000 users across over 150 servers.
				I wrote and tested this bot on my phone with a text editor, a linux terminal (termux) and a very tiny mobile screen allowing me to see about 5-6 lines of code at a time and only 20-30 characters per line. 
				I eventually hosted it on heroku and to this day even though it is now older and a little obsolete and there are now alternatives available it still gets used quite a bit.
				One thing I learned during this experience is don't write code on your phone if you want to keep your sanity.
