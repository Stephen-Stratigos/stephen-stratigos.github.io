			<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				My project idea is aimed at making it easier and quicker for emergency response vehicles to respond to emergencies on the road.
				It consists of a signal sent out by emergency vehicles when they have their lights activated. This signal will act as a proximity
				signal as well as carry some basic gps information. This information would be received by the non emergency vehicle and would
				deliver a 3 teir visual/audio warning depending on proximity and location factors. This is to speed up driver awareness of emergency vehicles
				and eliminate the possibility of car radios drowning out sirens. The visual warnings will be provided via 1 or more LED indicators
				installed somewhere in or around the dashboard and the audio warning, used at the highest warning teir, will be integrated with the cars
				speaker system allowing the system to cut off all other audio sources and deliver its own warning audio.
				Such a system would likely need to be delivered through a government initiative. If taken to the transport minister and approved
				such a system would have to be made mandatory to be affective. This could be rolled out as a safety feature into new cars. For 
				older cars the system would have to be rolled out using esafety pink slip checks at cost of the government. This technology could
				become a necessary component to pass an esafety check and could even potentially be used to automate the issuing of tickets for obstruction
				of emergency vehicles.
			</p>
			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>
				My motivation behind this project does not come from any researched statistics or inside knowledge. My motivation comes from all
				the times I personally have seen emergency vehicles trying to respond to an emergency only to get stuck behind a driver who hasn't noticed
				the emergency vehicle or just doesn't care. Maybe the driver is deaf and a visual indicator on the dash would make them aware.
				Maybe the driver has their stereo up too loud to hear the sirens. It doesn't matter what the reason is it will be eliminated by this
				system. As for drivers that don't care there is the possibility for automated ticketing should the government approve it. Just in my
				personal experience I have seen these senarios too many times. When I see an ambulance responding to a medical emergency get stuck
				behind an oblivious driver all I can think about is the poor patient waiting for that ambulance. Will the precious time wasted behind
				that driver cost someone their life? If I am one driver witnessing this how many other drivers will witness the same ambulance
				get stuck on this same call? How many other drivers will see other emergency vehicles get stuck on a given day? How many deaths, burned
				down houses and violent assaults could have been reduced in severity or eliminated completely if this problem wasn't a factor.
			</p>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
				The emergency vehicle side of the system would consist of a proximity signal that is emitted in all directions. This signal should have an approximate
				range that it travels. For example you could aim for 3 kilometers and that way you should reach everyone within a sufficient range. 
				Target range can be tweaked after testing. The emergency vehicle will also have a gps attached to the system that transmits the current
				street and either approximate street number or direction of travel of the emergency vehicle as part of the proximity signal.
				<br><br>
				The residential/commercial vehicle side of the system would consist of a receiver for the signal transmitted by the emergency vehicle
				and would either integrate with a cars existing gps or would have a basic gps installed that comes with the system and is stripped back
				to only give functionality required by the system to reduce cost. The system would also have a hub for the speaker system that allows it
				to electronically swap the speaker system between a standard channel or a warning channel. Everything in the car that isn't part of the system
				will run through the standard channel so that in 3rd teir warnings the speakers can be hijacked and a warning tone or message played to 
				the driver. Updating of gps maps can be performed during esafety checks.
				<br><br>
				A teir one warning will simply be if a proximity signal is detected. This warning is displayed to the driver through the LED warning on the dash.
				The LED warning system could consist of three LEDs or one LED with variable colour output.
				<br>
				A teir two warning will become active if the systems gps location matches the street transmitted by the emergency vehicle or if the street and direction
				of both vehicles intersect.
				<br>
				A teir three warning would become active if a proximity signal is detected, the vehicles current streets match or intersect taking into account 
				travel direction and the approximate street addresses returned by both vehicles gps are within a certain range. As an example if the non 
				emergency vehicles gps calculates that the two vehicles paths are likely to intersect and the distance between their current locations is less
				than 500 meters a teir 3 warning would activate.
				<br><br>
				Some sort of system would be necessary to avoid conflicting emergency signals. Perhaps some sort of channel system where receivers take signals
				across a number of channels and emergency vehicles are set to a certain channel depending on what other channels vehicles in their area are using.
				<br><br>
				This system, while unlikely to be viable as a commercial product, has the potential to be picked up by our and possibly other governments as 
				a mandatory system to pass a roadworthy esafety check. The nature of this product means it will either go nowhere or go everywhere and I believe
				such a system could be made cheap enough to be well worth the benefit of reducing emergency vehicle congestion and the sudden panic some
				drivers experience when they look in the rear view mirror and notice there is an emergency vehicle stuck behind them.
			</p>
			<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
			<p>
				The hardware required on the emergency vehicle side would be a basic gps system, an rf transmitter that is calibrated to transmit at an
				appropriate range and some sort of link between the two. The link could be as simple as designing the gps to output the required data directly
				to the rf transmitter.
				<br><br>
				The hardware required on the residential/commercial side would be a basic gps system with the same output as the emergency vehicle one,
				An rf receiver that outputs the gps data picked up by an emergency vehicle and a control unit that takes the two components outputs and 
				performs the necessary calculations to determine warning teir and outputs the appropriate warning.
			</p>
			<h2>Skills Required</h2>
			<p>
				Some new hardware would need to be engineered. Gps would need to be designed to output the appropriate data and rf transmitters engineered
				to have a range that is suitable (not to long not to short). A control unit would also have to be engineered to take inputs and make map
				related calculations. The control unit software would have to have similarities to gps direction giving software to determine finer proximity
				and possible path intersections. I believe these skills and components would be reasonably easy to find as everything needed is already implemented
				in other products in one way or another.
			</p>
			<h2>Outcome</h2>
			<p>
				Should this product be successful it would become a requirement for all vehicle owners. Anywhere it gets implemented it would become mandatory.
				I believe this would solve the problem of emergency vehicles getting stuck behind drivers and would reduce risky actions by surprised drivers
				via early warning. If this product is successful it could not only have a huge impact on emergency response times it could literally save
				peoples lives and/or livelihood. It could also have a positive impact on insurance companies due to quicker emergency response times and 
				create jobs for the manufacturing and auto-electrical industries.
