			<h1>Myers-Briggs</h1>

			<p>
				My results to the Myers-Briggs test give me some insight as to how I might
				perform under certain situations. I am happy with the results and they seem
				to be mostly quite balanced or trending towards what I see as a more preferable
				result except for maybe the mind trait. I know full well that I prefer to work
				alone and solve problems on my own but I recognise how this could be an issue
				in a professional workplace environment.
			</p>
			<p>
				My introverted nature may have some impact on my ability to work in a team but
				given the opportunity to get to know my peers will help me ease into a team environment.
				I believe the other traits are good for team work. A balance in energy will allow me 
				to both observe and provide input for a problem. My nature score tells me while I 
				will take emotion into consideration I will still favour logic when making a decision.
				My tactics score tells me I will spend more time finding solutions than picking 
				apart already proposed solutions. My identity score tells me I will have no issues
				with being confident in my abilities or decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				When forming a team I should try and seek out members that have a more extroverted
				persona so my interactions with them are increased and I can become familiar and
				more comfortable with them quicker.

			<p>
				These results just confirm what I already knew which is that I predominantly learn
				through experience. I learn far more from practical exercises than I do from reading, 
				watching or listening to instructions.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a team environment I believe this will be helpful in certain situations. While other
				team members may better learn and solve problems together with their collective knowledge
				via communication I will be more equipped to figure out problems that arise that 
				the team collectively has no or little experience or knowledge.
			</p>
			<p>
				When forming a team I should keep my learning style in mind. I should make sure that 
				any team I become a member of has resources available to me to cater to my learning style.

			<h1>Logic Test</h1>
			<a href="https://www.practiceaptitudetests.com/test/logical-reasoning-tests/1"> The logic test used can be found here </a>
			<br>
			<img src="logic.png" height="400px" width="300px" align="center" />
			<p>
				My results in this test tell me that I am capable of logical thinking and finding solutions 
				to problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think these results tell me I would be valuable in a team where our tasks require logical 
				thinking. I believe it will be especially useful in a programming environment.
			</p>
			<p>
				When forming a team I should take these results into account and look for members that look
				at problems in a more abstract way. While I believe logical thinking is the most useful tool
				in problem solving I also believe the ability to look at problems in a creative manner is 
				important.
