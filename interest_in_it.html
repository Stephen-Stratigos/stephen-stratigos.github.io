				My interest in IT, while hard to pinpoint, I think started when I was 12 and I was at my friends house and his parents were on their home computer. 
				The computer started making weird noises and after a little bit it went quiet. Now the computer had access to all these flashy, attention seeking 90's web pages.
				I asked my friend what it was and he told me "That is the internet" and his parents let us have a bit of a play around with it.
				Until that day my experience with computers was my commodore 64 so the experience blew my mind. I believe that is where my interest first piqued.
				There are many aspect of IT that interest me but the thing that I enjoy most is producing code that can solve a problem or help make something easier.
				I am very interested in machine learning. I have some understanding of it and how it works but even though through knowledge the "magic" of machine learning has been taken away I still find myself amazed by machine learning.
				Seeing a computer recognise images or learning how to play or even cheat at games or even just taking info about you to make movie recommendations is something I find amazing and look forward to seeing what comes of the field in the future.

				I think the most influential person who really set in stone my interest in IT was one of my high school friends.
				We used to build and overclock home computers quite often and would make custom cases with cardboard etc. but the thing that really got me interested was he introduced me to programming.
				We used to sit at his computer after school building games in Delphi. Our skills were what you would expect from a couple of kids but it kicked off a life long dream/journey that I would drop and pick back up many times over the years.

				I chose to come to RMIT because I wanted to learn. I visited the OUA website and looked into computer science degrees not really knowing exactly what I was looking for.
				I did not meet the prerequisites for the degree I was looking at and enquired via their live chat as to whether or not there was a work around for the prerequisites. The person I spoke to couldn't help me with that but recommended to me my current course.
				I really liked the look of this course and felt it probably fit me better than computer science anyway so I signed up on the spot.

				The main thing I would like to learn from my studies is as much knowledge in programming as I can take in but I expect to learn about all aspect of IT to some degree and come away with the skills to start working in or working towards any IT related field I could possibly want to persue in the future.
